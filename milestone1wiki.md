1. System Description:

"Provides a comprehensive, insightful, and detailed overview of the application, its objectives, and goals."

The MisterEd system is envisioned as a solution aimed at mitigating the burdens of overcrowding and prolonged wait times within Emergency Departments (EDs) across Canada.It is designed to allows users to both check the current load of the ER as well as register/log in for a virtual triage. The virtual triage involves the user providing necessary medical information, allowing the system to conduct an initial assessment of their condition. After this virtual triage is complete, their patient data will be updated and the user will be notified of which actions they should follow. In cases where an ER visit is deemed necessary, the system integrates the user into a virtual ER queue, prioritizing them based on the urgency of their condition. The user will then be notified when the ER is ready for them (front of the queue), significantly reducing their wait time and enhancing the overall ED experience. The system will reserves a spot for the user at the ER for a designated period, after which the user will be removed from the queue. If the patient may not require an ER visit, they will be directed to suitable alternatives, relayed to either a nurse hotline, regular primary care clinic, or over-the counter-medication. Thus, the system helps to optimize the utilization of healthcare resources and promote timely and appropriate care for all users.

    Here is our groups use case diagram:
    ![Use Case Diagram](https://ibb.co/Z6MJ879)

   Here are our groups individual use case descriptions ordered by use case number:

|     | Information                                                        |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Description**    | This use case provides an overview of how to access and use the MisterEd system. |
| **Assumption**     | The user is interested in using MisterEd to determine if they need to visit an Emergency Department (ED). The user may either register for MisterEd for the first time or use their existing account to log in. |
| **Actors**         | - User/Patient<br> - ED IT Technician<br> - Nurse<br> - Pharmacist<br> - General Physician (GP) |
| **Steps**          | 1. **User Registration/Login:**<br> - The user either logs in with their existing MisterEd account or registers for a new account for the first time.<br> 2. **Assessment for Nearby ED Availability:**<br> - The user determines if there is an available Emergency Department (ED) nearby.<br> 3. **Health Information Submission:**<br> - The user utilizes MisterEd to provide personal health information, which the system uses to determine the appropriate action.<br> 4. **Decision Making:**<br> - Based on the provided health information, MisterEd determines the appropriate course of action for the user.<br><br>    4.1. If the user should visit a nearby ED:<br> - The ED is informed of the user's need.<br>  - The ED system checks for an available spot in the queue for the user.<br>  - The user is notified when an ED spot becomes available.<br><br>    4.2. Otherwise: <br> 4.2.1 If the user should receive a prescription:<br>  - The nearby pharmacy is informed and contacts the user to prescribe medication.<br>    4.2.2 If the user should talk to a nurse via a hotline:<br>   - A nurse is informed and contacts the user to provide assistance.<br> 4.2.3 If the user should visit a clinic to see a GP:<br>  - The nearby clinic is informed and reaches out to the user to set up an appointment.<br> |
| **Variations**     | - If the user finds that medication, the nurse hotline, or visiting a GP is not sufficient, they may want the system to recommend a visit to an ED. |
| **Non-Functional Requirements** | 1. **Reliability:**<br> - Given the potential urgency of a userâ€™s needs, the system must ensure that status notifications reach the respective recipients as soon as possible.<br> 2. **User-Friendly Interface:**<br> - The system's interface should be designed to accommodate users with varying levels of computer experience, reducing the time it takes for users to navigate and use the platform. |
| **Issues**         | - **Miscommunication:** In some cases, the system may misinterpret user health information, resulting in incorrect recommendations. <br> - **Inconsistent Notifications:** Users report receiving inconsistent or delayed notifications regarding the availability of ED spots or appointments. |

| Description    | User is assigned to an appropriate ED queue position using user location and virtual triage data.              
| Actors         | Patient/User (primary) <br> ED front desk operator                                                        
| Assumption     | The patient provides correct information about their health condition and finishes the triage and their data is correctly processed. |
| Steps          | 1. The information from the triage is used to determine the position in ED queue that the user will take. <br> 2. User is informed of their current position in queue through notifaction use case <br>  3. When the user has reached the front of the queue, they will be notified again to come to the ED. <br> 4. When the user arrives at the ED, they are ID'd and matched to their online information, and then processed accordingly by ED front desk operator. <br> 5. Once processed the user is removed from the queue.
| Variations     |   #1 User may decide to cancel and be removed from the queue. <br> #2 User fails to arrive within specified time frame, they are removed from the queue and notified.|
| Non-functional |   Reliability: ED queue system must be very reliable to have user trust. <br> Priority: ED queue system must be able to effectivley decide urgency and priority of users. |
| Issues         |   How does the ED staff interact with the system? How are in-person ED visitors accounted for in the system? |

| Assumption     | 1. User is currently in ED queue <br> 2. User has exceeded given time period for ED visit|
| Steps          | 2.1 If the user fails to arrive within specified time period, then they are removed from queue in the system. <br> 2.2 User is notified that they have failed to show up in their alloted time and have been removed from the queue. |
| Issues         | Timing can be tricky, if someone is in serious peril they shouldn't be turned away because of technicality |

| Variations     | N/A|
| Non-functional |   Reliability: the load data for the ED will be accurate within the most recent 5 minutes  <br> Usability: The displayed data for the ED load will update without the need for the user to reload the page <br> Security: Only the Current load data can be accessed  |
| Issues         |   The ability to access Load data may be lost to the user for the duration of a power failure or duration taken to update the mister ED system |



                                            
                                    

2. Contributions

Everyone collaborated to setting up team communication (Discord) and team expectations.

Everyone contributed collaboratively to the designing of the general road map to decide on our use cases.

Each member was assigned 1 use case to complete on their own time.

Miles wrote the system description and team members reviewed the writing and suggested edits and additions.
