| Description    | The goal of this use case is to enable users to log in, and successfully complete the triage process. Requirements for this include user's login credentials, and a seamless triage workflow.            
| Actors         | Patient/User (Primary).                                                  
| Assumption     | 1) The Mister ED System is Online/Active <br> 2) The user has already registered with their health information on the system. |
| Steps          | 1) On the welcome/ home page, the user logs-in. <br> 2) The user starts the virtual triage to determine if going to the ER is the only option. <br> 5) After completing the virtual triage, the user would be given the result of whether to go to the ER, visit a nearby clinic, visit a nearby pharmacy and get medicine over the counter, or provides contact information to the nurse hotline.
| Issues         |  The main issue that may arise when going through the virtual triage is if the patient's condition becomes dangerous, for example if the patient were to lose consciousness while using the system and no one was with them, then the patient might not be able to get the right treatment in time. |
