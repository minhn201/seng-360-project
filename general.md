| **Description**    | This use case provides an overview of how to access and use the MisterEd system. |
| **Assumption**     | The user is interested in using MisterEd to determine if they need to visit an Emergency Department (ED). The user may either register for MisterEd for the first time or use their existing account to log in. |
| **Actors**         | - User/Patient<br> - ED IT Technician<br> - Nurse<br> - Pharmacist<br> - General Physician (GP) |
| **Steps**          | 1. **User Registration/Login:**<br> - The user either logs in with their existing MisterEd account or registers for a new account for the first time.<br> 2. **Assessment for Nearby ED Availability:**<br> - The user determines if there is an available Emergency Department (ED) nearby.<br> 3. **Health Information Submission:**<br> - The user utilizes MisterEd to provide personal health information, which the system uses to determine the appropriate action.<br> 4. **Decision Making:**<br> - Based on the provided health information, MisterEd determines the appropriate course of action for the user.<br><br>    4.1. If the user should visit a nearby ED:<br> - The ED is informed of the user's need.<br>  - The ED system checks for an available spot in the queue for the user.<br>  - The user is notified when an ED spot becomes available.<br><br>    4.2. Otherwise: <br> 4.2.1 If the user should receive a prescription:<br>  - The nearby pharmacy is informed and contacts the user to prescribe medication.<br>    4.2.2 If the user should talk to a nurse via a hotline:<br>   - A nurse is informed and contacts the user to provide assistance.<br> 4.2.3 If the user should visit a clinic to see a GP:<br>  - The nearby clinic is informed and reaches out to the user to set up an appointment.<br> |
| **Variations**     | - If the user finds that medication, the nurse hotline, or visiting a GP is not sufficient, they may want the system to recommend a visit to an ED. |
| **Non-Functional Requirements** | 1. **Reliability:**<br> - Given the potential urgency of a userâ€™s needs, the system must ensure that status notifications reach the respective recipients as soon as possible.<br> 2. **User-Friendly Interface:**<br> - The system's interface should be designed to accommodate users with varying levels of computer experience, reducing the time it takes for users to navigate and use the platform. |
| **Issues**         | - **Miscummunication:** In some cases, the system may misinterpret user health information, resulting in incorrect recommendations. <br> - **Inconsistent Notifications:** Users report receiving inconsistent or delayed notifications regarding the availability of ED spots or appointments. |
