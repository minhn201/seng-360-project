| **Description**    | This use case provides an overview of how to access and use the MisterEd system. |
| **Assumption**     |The user is seeking medical guidance or assistance through the MisterEd system. They may be experiencing a health issue or concern and are using MisterEd to assess whether their situation requires a visit to an Emergency Department (ED). Users may choose to either create a new MisterEd account if using the system for the first time or log in with their existing account for access. |
| **Actors**         | - User/Patient<br> - ED IT Technician<br> - Nurse<br> - Pharmacist<br> - General Physician (GP) |
| **Steps**          | 1. **User Registration/Login:**<br> - The user either logs in with their existing MisterEd account or registers for a new account for the first time.<br> 2. **Assessment for Nearby ED Availability:**<br> - The user determines if there is an available Emergency Department (ED) nearby.<br> 3. **Health Information Submission:**<br> - The user utilizes MisterEd to provide personal health information, which the system uses to determine the appropriate action.<br> 4. **Decision Making:**<br> - Based on the provided health information, MisterEd determines the appropriate course of action for the user.<br><br>    4.1. If the user should visit a nearby ED:<br> - The ED is informed of the user's need.<br>  - The ED system checks for an available spot in the queue for the user.<br>  - The user is notified when an ED spot becomes available.<br><br>    4.2. Otherwise, if the user should receive medical assistance through alternative means: <br> 4.2.1 If the user should receive a prescription: <br> - The system notifies the user of the nearby pharmacy where they can obtain their prescribed medication. <br> 4.2.2 If the user should talk to a nurse via a hotline: <br> - The system notifies the user and provides access to a nurse hotline for immediate assistance. <br> 4.2.3 If the user should visit a clinic to see a GP: <br> - The system notifies the user of a nearby clinic and assists in setting up an appointment with a General Physician (GP). |
| **Variations**     |     |
| **Non-Functional Requirements** | 1. **Reliability:**<br> - Given the potential urgency of a userâ€™s needs, the system must ensure that status notifications reach the respective recipients as soon as possible.<br> 2. **User-Friendly Interface:**<br> - The system's interface should be designed to achieve a 20% reduction in the average time it takes for users, including those with limited computer experience, to navigate and perform essential tasks on the platform compared to the previous interface. |
| **Issues**         | - **Miscummunication:** In some cases, the system may misinterpret user health information, resulting in incorrect recommendations. <br> - **Inconsistent Notifications:** Users report receiving inconsistent or delayed notifications regarding the availability of ED spots or appointments. |
